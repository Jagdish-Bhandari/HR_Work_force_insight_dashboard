## 📊 Results and Findings:
- ⚖️ Stable Workforce Capacity: 24.9K active employees suggest strong hiring practices but demand ongoing retention focus.
- ❗ Early Tenure Risk: Higher attrition among employees with <2 years’ tenure hints at onboarding or expectation mismatch.
- 🧗 Career Stagnation: Promotion gaps for 2–4 year tenured staff indicate bottlenecks in internal mobility.
- 😓 Work-Life Imbalance in Operations Roles: Especially in Sales, Healthcare, and Support teams—contributing to burnout.
- 🕒 Tenure Disparity: Departments like R&D and Sales have shorter average tenures, signaling retention and engagement challenges.

## 🚧 Limitations (Challenges Faced):
- Incomplete or inconsistent data for older tenure records and performance history.
- Potential bias in subjective ratings like work-life balance and job satisfaction.
- Department definitions and job role groupings required manual standardization.
- Lacked detailed exit interviews data to further understand attrition drivers.

## ✅ Key Takeaway:
Your analysis shines a light on key strategic HR challenges:
- A robust workforce needs retention scaffolding, not just size.
- Career mobility and onboarding quality are critical levers to reduce early exits.
- Engagement gaps are role-specific—and must be solved that way.
- Real-time HR dashboards can empower smarter decision-making across the org.
